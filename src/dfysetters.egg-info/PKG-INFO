## About The Project

This project was created for the Done For You Setters team. It supports our switch from using humans to set, to using software. We are in the very early stages of the project, and we are focused primarily on tracking team numbers, along with standardising onboarding for both team and clients. We think that software is crucial to be able to scale our setting agency

Here's why:
* The quantity of high quality setters in the indsutry is low, meaning we are bottlenecked by talent
* A lot of the chat process for setters is repetitive, meaning once we have decided a good reply, we have to continue to make that decision every day
* Code is more reliable than humans, giving us consistency when tracking our numbers

### Built With

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.2.0/)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/)

## Features

* Count how many facebook messages we missed in a given time frame
* Rank the team based on their key metrics
* Pull TC Booked Data for each client
* Pull TC Scheduled Data for each client
* Onboard new team members with one script

### Prerequisites

These are the things you need to use the software and how to install them. All of our software right now is DFY Setters specific, meaning you will need the below accounts for it to work correctly

* settersandspecialists.com G Suite Account
* Access to the CoachingSales.com Slack workspace

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/louisrae/dfysetters`

2. `cd dfysetters`

3. `virtualenv venv`

4. `. venv/bin/activate`

5. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

Rank all team members by metric
`leaderboard = Leaderboard(level_10_sheet)`
`weekly_totals = leaderboard.getWeekTotalFromLevel10()`
`rank_team_members = leaderboard.getSortedTCandSSNumbersForTeamMembers(role_list, weekly_totals)`

Invites team member to Slack channels based on pod
`team_member = get_row_of_database_based_on_name()`
`user_id, channels = slack_data_setup(team_member)`
`client.conversations_invite(channel=channel, users=user_id)`

For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/louisrae/dfysetters)

## Roadmap

- [] Release on PyPi
- [] Daily usage inside of the settersandspecialists organization
- [] Move client trackers to databases
